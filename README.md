# Forced Exit

An [Oxygen Not Included](https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included) mod which forcibly quits
the game after it has been saved if you have been playing for longer than a given number of hours,
or if the hour matches a given time of day.

If you have ever played ONI, you'll know why I needed this mod.

Install it from the Steam workshop:
